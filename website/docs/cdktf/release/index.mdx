# Releases

We release CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) regularly. The [CHANGELOG on Github](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) contains details about bug fixes, new features, and deprecations.

## Upgrade Guides

CDKTF includes upgrade guides for releases that have breaking changes.

- [Upgrading to v0.10](/cdktf/release/upgrade-guide-v0-10)
- [Upgrading to v0.9](/cdktf/release/upgrade-guide-v0-9)
- [Upgrading to v0.7](/cdktf/release/upgrade-guide-v0-7)
- [Upgrading to v0.6](/cdktf/release/upgrade-guide-v0-6)

## Enable Features

CDKTF uses feature flags to enable potentially breaking behaviors in a release. You can use them to change the logic when synthesizing code or CLI features, but they cannot change the logic of the provider generation.

Feature flags are disabled by default, so existing projects that do not specify the flag will continue to work as expected with later CDKTF releases. However, new projects created using `cdktf init` include flags enabling all features available in the release that created the project.

Edit the [`cdktf.json` configuration file](/cdktf/create-and-deploy/configuration-file#enable-features) to disable flags for which you prefer the old behavior, or to add flags to enable new behaviors after upgrading. The CHANGELOG contains a description of new feature flags in each release, and the CDKTF source file [features.ts](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/blob/main/packages/cdktf/lib/features.ts) provides a complete list of all feature flags.

### `excludeStackIdFromLogicalIds`

When set, the stack id is excluded from generated logical ids for constructs within the stack. This means constructs that are top-level to the stack will have a logical id that is the same as their construct id.
When you use nested constructs the mechanism will add a suffix to the logical id to make it unique.

### `allowSepCharsInLogicalIds`

When set, '\_' and '-' are allowed in logical ids.
